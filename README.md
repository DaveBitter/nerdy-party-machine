# React boilerplate

## Getting started
React boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Scripts

#### Run development environment

* Stating the obvious; make sure you got Node and npm/yarn installed on your machine and run `yarn install` or `npm install`.
* Copy `example.env` to `.env` and paste the required keys

There are a couple of scripts you can run after this:

`yarn dev` or `yarn start` - starts the development environment with hot-module-reloading and all that good stuff.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`yarn test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
